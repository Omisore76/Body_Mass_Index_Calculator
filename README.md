# Body_Mass_Index_Calculator

## Project Aim

The aim of the project is to develop a calculator using bash script to determine the BMI of a user. 

## Introduction

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to both adult men and women. BMI values are expressed in kg/m2 and are generally categorized as follows: underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI = 25-29.9 kg/m2), and obese (BMI >= 30)

To use the script, simply enter your height and weight when prompted. The body mass index will then be calculated using the standard formula.
With the calculated body mass index, the program will then check if you are underweight, overweight, or have healthy body weight.
